# vue-cordova-demo

This repository is an example of using the [vue-cordova](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-cordova) package. You may use this code to test your dev environment or get inspiration to implement `vue-cordova` in your Vue-based mobile app.

**This example features VueJS 2.x. For 1.x versions, check the `vue1.x` branch of this repository.**

## Install

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# build static files
npm run build

# set up Cordova platforms and plugins
cordova prepare

# check for Cordova requirements
cordova requirements

# test in iOS simulator (or using whatever device you may have)
cordova run ios
```

## Notes

This demo has been tested on OSX, to build an iOS app. I can't guarantee it will work on another setup, feedback is welcome.
